/**
 * Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * "tree"
 * Output:
 * "eert"
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
 * So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 * "cccaaa"
 * Output:
 * "cccaaa"
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
 * Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * Input:
 * "Aabb"
 * Output:
 * "bbAa"
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
 * Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
