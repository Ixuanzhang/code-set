/**
 * Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it.
 * <p>
 * For example,
 * path = "/home/", => "/home"
 * path = "/a/./b/../../c/", => "/c"
 * path = "/a/../../b/../c//.//", => "/c"
 * path = "/a//b////c/d//././/..", => "/a/b/c"
 * <p>
 * In a UNIX-style file system, a period ('.') refers to the current directory, so it can be ignored in a simplified path. Additionally, a double period ("..") moves up a directory, so it cancels out whatever the last directory was. For more information, look here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)#Unix_style
 * <p>
 * Corner Cases:
 * Did you consider the case where path = "/../"?
 * In this case, you should return "/".
 * Another corner case is the path might contain multiple slashes '/' together, such as "/home//foo/".
 * In this case, you should ignore redundant slashes and return "/home/foo".
