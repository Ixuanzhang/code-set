/**
 * Given n points in the plane that are all pairwise distinct, a "boomerang" is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).
 * Find the number of boomerangs. You may assume that n will be at most 500 and coordinates of points are all in the range [-10000, 10000] (inclusive).
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]
 * Output:
 * 2
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]]
 * <p>
 * 注意N=500，可以设计O(N*N)级别
